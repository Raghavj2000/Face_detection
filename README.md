Face Detection App
Overview
This React application leverages the MediaPipe Face Landmarker to detect facial features and determine if a face is straight. The application opens the camera, performs real-time facial detection, and allows capturing and downloading images if certain conditions are met.

Features
Camera Integration: Opens the camera to capture real-time video.
Face Detection: Uses MediaPipe's Face Landmarker to detect facial landmarks.
Face Orientation Check: Verifies if the face is straight before allowing image capture.
Image Capture: Takes a screenshot of the video feed and crops it to a square.
Image Download: Provides an option to download the captured image.
